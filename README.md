# Coursera-Project-Gilets-Jaunes
It has been now 5 months that Gilets Jaunes are demonstrating in Paris. Some are pacific whereas an increasing number of "black blocs" are decimating the old neighborhoods of the town, trashing streets and buildings and specifically targetting Gastronomic Restaurants, Luxury shops and other so-called symbolic places. The global cost for France is currently above the hundred million of euros.  In this project, we will try to identify the neighboorhods that are the most likely to be subject to vandalism and try to find neighborhoods where the manifestors could be headed over in order to avoid damage as much as possible.  We believe that it can help the French Government and Paris citizens to estimate what damages could be done in case of a march. It is also essential for the Gilets Jaunes who are truly willing to speak their voice during a planned and government accepted-march, and want to demonstrate without the violences and degradations that had accompagnied them every Saturday.  We make this project public and we know that there are plenty of other factors to take into account on this very sensitive subject. This project is just a preliminary to further analyses.
